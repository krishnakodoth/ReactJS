# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Error boundaries in React
### [blog.logrocket.com](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-error-handling-with-react-error-boundary/)
#

In terms of where to place these error boundaries, they can be set up around the entire app or individual components for more granular control. Itâ€™s important to note that error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and constructors of the whole tree below them. However, error boundaries do not catch errors for:

Event handlers (for that, you need to use regular try/catch)
Asynchronous code (e.g., setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
Server-side rendering
Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)
Error boundaries were introduced in React v16, and to use them, you need to define a class component with either or both of the following lifecycle methods: getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch().
